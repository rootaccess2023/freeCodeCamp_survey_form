## Project Description

The survey form is designed to collect user information and preferences. It includes a variety of input types such as text, email, number, dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a textarea. The form also incorporates HTML5 validation to ensure that users provide the correct input format.

## User Stories

The form meets the following user story requirements:

- **Title**: A heading displaying the title of the form in an `<h1>` tag with the `id` "title".
- **Description**: A paragraph explaining the purpose of the form in a `<p>` tag with the `id` "description".
- **Form Structure**: A `<form>` element with the `id` "survey-form" that encapsulates all input fields.
- **Name Input**: A text input field for the user's name with the `id` "name".
- **Email Input**: An email input field for the user's email with the `id` "email", utilizing HTML5 validation to enforce email format.
- **Number Input**: A numeric input field for entering a number with the `id` "number", which restricts input to numbers and enforces a minimum and maximum value range.
- **Labels**: Each input field has a corresponding `<label>` element with matching `id` attributes for accessibility.
- **Placeholders**: Each input field has placeholder text to guide users on the expected input.
- **Dropdown Menu**: A dropdown selection with the `id` "dropdown" offering at least two options.
- **Radio Buttons**: A group of radio buttons allowing users to select one option from a set.
- **Checkboxes**: A series of checkboxes for users to select multiple items, each with a unique `value` attribute.
- **Textarea**: A textarea for users to provide additional comments.
- **Submit Button**: A button with the `id` "submit" to finalize the form submission.

## Running the Project

To run this project locally, you'll need to clone the repository, set up a local web server, and open the HTML file in your browser. Since the form uses HTML5 validation, it requires a web server environment to function correctly.
